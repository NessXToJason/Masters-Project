# Masters-Project

## Background
The original E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial video game was released for the Atari 2600 in December of 1982. The game was a commercial failure and one of many poor-quality video games considered to have contributed to the 1983 video game market crash. The game was infamously buggy and difficult for consumers to understand, with virtually no in-game direction and a much too complicated premise for what could be displayed on the Atari.

## Abstract
This project reimagines the original game from the ground up to create a “what-if” rendition of the game where it was given more development time and much better development tools. The design philosophy for this remake is to recapture the general gameplay and feel of the original but fix its most game-breaking issues. The process also involved rethinking some questionable game design decisions that may have resulted from time constraints and hardware limitations of the time.
